Use plot_time_simulation.m file to load the data and generate the plots

Meaning of some expressions in naming the data:
-	XY3: both the X and Y matrices (related to the Lyapunov function) are parameter-dependent. I believe I discussed this in the paper
-	heuSS: heuristically selected (i.e. not optimized) switching surfaces
-	optSS: optimized switching surfaces
-	3subs: dividing the range of theta_1 into three subsets
-	Proj: using the projected LMI conditions (which have less decision variables)
-	Max: minimizing the worst-case performance across all the subsets, (instead of a weighted 
-	jnl: for journal submission; this is for distinguishing the data used for this journal submission and (an earlier) conference submission
-	nojump: cannot remember its exact meaning now
